        summary:
          "Supervised learning uses labeled datasets to train models, ideal for prediction tasks like classification and regression. Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or groupings through clustering and dimensionality reduction. This article compares use cases, advantages, and limitations of both approaches."

        summary:
          "Supervised learning involves mapping inputs to outputs using labeled examples, while unsupervised learning focuses on discovering inherent structures in data without predefined labels. This article explains algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, K-Means, and PCA with practical scenarios."
